### [Advanced Econometrics Project 1](https://github.com/Melez99/AE-Project)
* R Markdown project developed for the Advanced Econometrics module of my BSC in Economics with econometrics.
* The project relies on various statistical methods to provide empirical content on the economic relationship
between the Capacity Utilisation Rate and the Inflation Rate of the USA. Indeed, Inflation is highly correlated
with the nominal interest rate as when inflation rises, the central bank raises the nominal interest rate to
counter it, thus reducing the growth rate of GDP to maintain inflation at acceptable levels for economic
functionality. However, the Federal Reserve ends up reducing both demand and supply in the process and,
thus, capacity utilisation decreases.
* The project contains a Time Series Analysis on the impact of TCU on Inflation Rate.
   + Database fetched directly from the FRED website.
   + Models run both in levels and first differences. 
   + Unit Root tests: ADF, PP and KPSS. 
   + Cointegration tests: Engle-Granger and Johansen. 
   + ARDL model and PSS bounds test.
   + Diagnostic tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Breusch-Godfrey, Jarque-Bera) and Impulse Response Functions.
   + VAR model and Granger-Causality test. 
   + Cholesky-Decomposition and IRFs.
   + ARIMA and SARIMA models.

   + Instrumental Variable (IV). 
   + 2SLS model. 
   + GMM model.

### [Econometrics Project](https://github.com/Melez99/Econometrics_Project)
* R project developed for the Econometrics module of my BSC in Economics with econometrics.
* The project focuses on regression analysis, determining how closing the Gender Pay Gap (GPG), through a change in the average hourly wage rate of women will affect GDP, providing valid econometric results that will give insights into GDP and GPG trend relationships. Initially, the project discusses how a female over-representation in lower-paid jobs and under-representation in higher-paid careers, due to unpaid traditional care is not allowing optimal GDP growth, which would be reached by transmuting unpaid care into paid care, augmenting economical profits. Subsequentially, quantitative data is analysed to determine the effects of the reduction in GPG through an increase in the average hourly wage rate of female workers.
* Standard OLS estimates are obtained through a classic linear regression model (CLRM), and the null hypothesis which states that reducing GPG would lead to an increase in the rate of GDP growth is confirmed by a regression model in first differences and an autoregressive distributed lag model, computed following the conduction of autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson), unit root (ADF and Phillips-Perron), cointegration (Engle-Granger and Johansen), and heteroskedasticity (Breusch-Pagan) tests.

### [From National Statistics to Big Data (FNSTBD) Project](https://github.com/Melez99/FNSTBD-Project)
* Excel project developed for the FNSTBD module of my BSC in Economics with econometrics.
* The project analyses the correlation between economic growth, represented by GDP per capita and Environmental degradation, represented by CO2 emissions per capita, the main driver of GHG, in different stages of development. 
* Although CO2 has increased in atmospheric concentration by 30% circa from the start of the industrial revolution to 1992, researchers obtain contrasting results on the relationship between the two variables, especially in projects focused on individual countries, which neglect the diversity of income levels and ecological characteristics as determinants of diverse results (Heil and Selden, 2001). This project focuses on measuring the influence of GDP per capita on CO2 per capita by income level not by individual country, arguably attempting to solve these divergences. 
* The research is divided into 3 sections:
  + Inequalities of CO2 emissions per capita by income group in 2014. 
  + Evolution of CO2 emissions per capita by economic development area (Global North and Global South) between 1995 and 2014.
  + Regression Analysis.
* Techniques: 
  + Crosstabulations (pivot and contingency tables), frequency distributions, measures of location (e.g.
   mean, median, group averages) and dispersion (e.g. standard deviation, inter-quartile range,
80/20 ratio, top 1% percentile) are used to identify concentration tendencies and
characterise regional differences. 
  + Time series techniques are used to depict and numerically summarise the evolution of environmental degradation and compare it to economic growth in the Global North and Global South.
  + Linear regression techniques are applied to postulate, estimate and test relationships between
variables in the dataset, in a way conducive to answer the question posed. Statistical analysis is accompanied by an
economic analysis of the results.

### [Advanced Quantitative Economics Project](https://github.com/Melez99/AQE_Project)
* Excel project developed for the Advanced Quantitative Economics module of my BSC in Economics with econometrics.
* The project evaluates regional inequalities and determinants of spending by secondary schools in England.
* Economics can be applied to examine the spending of England by public secondary schools through microeconomic theory, based on economies and diseconomies of scale, and through macroeconomic theory, important for financial policy making such as the post 2008 economic crisis conservative laissez faire political agenda, consisting of the reduction of governmental spending on schooling, and its unintended consequences on economic growth that are still affecting school funding and spending nowadays, due to inflation problems, causing high levels of regional inequality and lower education standards. 
* In this project, I will elaborate on school expenditure, through statistical analysis, aimed to produce quantitative assessments, implementable across regions, considering their heterogeneity. 
* The research is divided into 3 sections, answering the following questions:
  + What is the extent of regional inequalities in expenditure by secondary schools?
  + What has been the recent evolution of total gross expenditure by secondary schools?
  + What are the determinants of secondary school expenditure?
* Techniques: 
  + Crosstabulations (pivot and contingency tables), frequency distributions, measures of location (e.g.
   mean, median, group averages) and dispersion (e.g. standard deviation, inter-quartile range,
80/20 ratio, top 1% percentile) are used to identify concentration tendencies and
characterise regional differences. 
  + Time series techniques are used to depict and numerically summarise the evolution of schools’
expenditure and compare it to funding provided in England.
  + Linear regression techniques are applied to postulate, estimate and test relationships between
variables in the dataset, in a way conducive to answer the question posed. The analysis
develops an economic rationale for including the chosen regressors to explain variation in the
dependent variable. Point estimates are reported, statistical significance of coefficients
assessed and hypotheses tests carried out. Statistical analysis is accompanied by an
economic analysis of the results.

### [Excel Interactive Dashboard Project](https://github.com/Melez99/Excel_Dashboard) 
* Excel dynamic dashboard on the performace of Superstore Inc.
* The project analyses sales and creates interactive data visualisation based on a dataset found on Kaggle.
* The structure of the dashboard was created with PowerPoint.

### [Tableau Interactive Dashboard Project](https://github.com/Melez99/Tableau_Dashboard)
* Tableau dashboard on the relationship between gender and salary, developed for the MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence Udemy course.
* The project is an intuitive data visualisation based on the modified employees database found on GitHub.
* The dashboard was constructed combining SQL and Tableau, extracting output tables from SQL and loading them in Tableau.
